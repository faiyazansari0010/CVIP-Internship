<h1>About Me</h1>
<br>
  <p>Hi everyone! My name is Faiyaz Ansari. I am currently in the final year of engineering pursuing Computer Science.
    Throughout my college years I have explored the C++ and python programming language and Data Structures and Algorithms.
    I have also worked on Frontend technologies like html, css and javascript. I have also made projects based on these technologies
    like online calculator, tic-tac-toe game and spotify clone. In my third year I had also done an SDE internship at ITJOBXS where I worked on the
    design and development of a fully responsive webpage for a particular section of ITJOBXS. I have also
    been a part of volunteering internship at TeachForIndia, which is an NGO that works in low income schools
    for the holistic development of students.
